Hi 👋, I'm Sunny Kumar Mishra

🛡️ Cybersecurity Learner | CTF Player | Bug Bounty Practitioner

## 🚀 About Me

I’m learning cybersecurity through **hands-on practice**, mainly by solving **CTF challenges**
and exploring **bug bounty methodologies**.

I focus on understanding how vulnerabilities actually work, how attackers think,
and how tools are used in real-world security testing.

---

## 🧠 What I Practice

- Solving CTF challenges (web, recon, basic networking)
- Learning bug bounty workflow and vulnerability discovery
- Reproducing known vulnerabilities in lab environments
- Reading write-ups and improving practical attack understanding

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tools (Learning / Practice Level)

- **Web Security:** XSS, SQL Injection, IDOR, authentication issues (basics)
- **Recon & Testing:** Port scanning, service enumeration, manual testing
- **Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit (basic usage)
- **Scripting:** Python (small automation and helper scripts)
- **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Windows, Ubuntu

## 📂 Current Project

- **redgnet.ai** *(In Progress)*  
  A practical **penetration testing assistant tool** aimed at helping with
  reconnaissance and initial vulnerability discovery.

  **Current focus:**
  - Handling target inputs (domains / IPs)
  - Automating basic recon tasks using open-source tools
  - Generating clean, structured output for analysis
  - Learning secure and scalable tool design

  > This project is part of my hands-on learning in bug bounty and penetration testing.
